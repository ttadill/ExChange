# Thrift Store (ExChange)

This project is a Thrift Store Management System built using Qt, C++, and QML.

## Prerequisites

- Qt (version 5.15 or later recommended)
- C++ compiler (compatible with your Qt version)
- qmake

## Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ExChange.git
   cd ExChange
   ```

2. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Run qmake:
   ```
   qmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```
   make
   ```

5. After successful compilation, you should have an executable file in the build directory.

## Running the Program

Run the executable file created in the build directory.

## Troubleshooting

### File Path Error

If you encounter a file path error while running the program, you may need to modify the file paths in `main.cpp`. Open `main.cpp` and update the file paths to match your system's directory structure.

### qmake Command Not Found

If the `qmake ..` command doesn't work, ensure that Qt is properly installed and that the Qt bin directory is added to your system's PATH. 

To add Qt to your PATH:

1. Find the Qt installation directory (e.g., `C:\Qt\5.15.2\mingw81_64\bin` on Windows or `/usr/lib/qt5/bin` on Linux).
2. Add this directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

For Windows:
- Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' > Properties > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables
- Edit the PATH variable and add the Qt bin directory

For Linux/macOS:
- Add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:
  ```
  export PATH="/path/to/qt/bin:$PATH"
  ```
- Run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile` to apply the changes

After setting the PATH, restart your terminal and try the `qmake ..` command again.
